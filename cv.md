## About Me:

My name is Valentin, I'm 22 years old. I have just started JavaScript/Front-end. Stage 0 course. Frankly speaking, I'm a people person, so it would not be a problem for me to work as a part of a team, however, at the same time, I could really focuse on job aims sitting alone somewhere. That is why I could adapt to all working conditions. Right now I'm on a steep lurning curve and looking forward to begin solve entertaining tasks.
